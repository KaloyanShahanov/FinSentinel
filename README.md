Cryptocurrency Price Tracker & Arbitrage Alert System (Personal Project – In Progress)
Developing a Python-based application that monitors cryptocurrency price changes across multiple exchanges, 
compares values between platforms and identifies potential arbitrage opportunities. 
Integrated with Slack via an API bot to deliver real-time alerts to a dedicated channel. Built entirely in Python, this project is a personal initiative and more of a hobby
